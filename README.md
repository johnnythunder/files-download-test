This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

Running the app is as simple as `npm start`.

Running tests can be done with `npm test`.

## Future Improvements/Optimizations

- Break `Button` into UI primitive
- Build more flexible data table component
- Update table row focus state to read all attributes for screen readers
- Increase unit test coverage
- Add Storybook for UI primitives
